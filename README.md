# Command Line Helper for Letter Frequency Attacks (For English Only)

## About The Program
Basic command line Python program that helps you to perform letter frequency attacks on texts that have been encrypted with substitution cipher.

This program doesn't perform the letter frequency attack on its own. It enables you to change the encrypted letters one by one and revert those changes if your change doesn't make sense. It also calculates frequencies of each character and groups frequent words by length to help you with the attack. Table and link below is going to be helpful while performing this attack.

When you finish the decryption, it also outputs a substitution table and the resulting text in separate text files. Here is the substitution letter regarding an example:

This program has been made with purpose to learn the LOGIC of the letter frequency attack in mind.

## Installation
